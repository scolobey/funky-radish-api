## Origin of the Chocolate Chip Cookie
Cookie genesis, the alpha and the omega of cookies, originating from the Toll House Chocolate Crunch Cookie, invented by Ruth Graves Wakefield in Whitman, Massechussetts in the late 1930's. this is the most widely recognized and consumed cookie in the modern world.

## What's in a Chocolate Chip Cookie?
In your typical Chocolate Chip Cookie recipe you'll see butter, sugar and eggs making up the core structure of the cookie. The base dough is flavored with salt, vanilla and chocolate. The original recipes seems to have also called for nuts. While this is not as common these days, it is not unheard of to toss in some walnut or pecan chunks.

## Simple truths
As with any recipe, there's a ton of subjectivity involved here. Your personal cookie preference is based on your tastes and your life experience. But there are a few details that we can agree on.

It's best to use a scale. If you bake regularly, a scale is invaluable and will pay for itself pretty quickly in time and reliability.

Here's the thing about scales... There are 2 numbers you need to be aware of. First, there's capacity. This is the maximum weight a scale can handle. If your scale has a capacity of 5 lb, any time you need to weight something over 5 lb (container included) you will need to do so in batches. That could get annoying fast, so make sure you've got a capacity rating that works for you. that being said, a 5 lb capacity should work for the vast majority of applications. The other number you need to know about is 'increments'. Any decent scale will mention this number. And here's where things get extra annoying. A typical 5 lb scale like the 2 linked above will measure to the nearest gram. So if you need accurate measurements under around 10g, you really need a separate scale. Why!? Well if you're trying to weigh out 6g of salt and your scale gives you 1g increments, you might be at 5.5g or you might be at 6.4g. So you can easily be off by around 10%, and that's assuming that your scale is accurate at low weights. If you're building a scale, you're interested in accuracy at the range it's intended for. In my experience, these 5 lb scales are just not useful weighing anything under 10g or within maybe a 4-5g accuracy.
